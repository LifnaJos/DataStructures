# To convert a postfix expression to a prefix expression, you can use the following algorithm:
## Algorithm :
1. Initialize a stack to store intermediate results.
2. Scan the postfix expression from left to right.
3. Process each symbol in the postfix expression:
   - If the symbol is an operand,
     - push it onto the stack.
   - If the symbol is an operator,
     - pop the top two operands from the stack.
     - Create a new string by concatenating the operator with the two operands in prefix order.
     - Push this new string back onto the stack.
4. At the end of the expression, the stack will contain one element, which is the prefix expression.

## Example Postfix Expression: AB+C*
- Read A: It's an operand. Push it onto the stack.
  Stack: ["A"]
- Read B: It's an operand. Push it onto the stack.
  Stack: ["A", "B"]
- Read +: It's an operator. Pop the top two operands (B and A). Create the prefix expression +AB. Push +AB onto the stack.
  Stack: ["+AB"]
- Read C: It's an operand. Push it onto the stack.
  Stack: ["+AB", "C"]
- Read *: It's an operator. Pop the top two operands (C and +AB). Create the prefix expression *+ABC. Push *+ABC onto the stack.
  Stack: ["*+ABC"]

At the end of the expression, the stack contains the prefix expression *+ABC.
